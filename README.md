**Planning Process**

The landing page to have Tic Tac Toe as a string, as well as a form/interactive buttons to signup and login. There will be form-fields to type in your email/username and password

On the gameplay page will have the tic tac toe playing field made with basic CSS, specifically with the use of borders

On the top left corner of the page, there will be a button that changes color to denote who’s turn it is, X or O. Plan on using Bootstrap for these buttons/as well as a command that will change the after a move has been set.

In the top right corner there will be logout and reset buttons to allow a player to logout of their current game or give them the option to reset the game.

Below the game board I will have a New game button to start a fresh game. Above that is where users will get their feedback (if they’ve stated a new game after reset, this will also “Welcome” the user upon login/stating a new game etc etc.

The stats screen will just denote the total wins and losses and ties for a user. This will be made with module or just boxes. The “reset” button on this page will reset the scores.

The change password screen will have the logout button in the top right again. Additionally, it will have a form-field for a username and a new password. Once those fields are complete, the user will hit the change password button. Then that event will take place/bring the user back to the initial login screen.

One of the 8 winner scenarios will just denote text at the bottom stating the player has won. There will be a button to logout and one to reset to the home screen.
