**Planning Process**

// The landing page to have Tic Tac Toe as a string, as well as a form/interactive buttons to signup and login. There will be form-fields to type in your email/username and password

// On the gameplay page will have the tic tac toe playing field made with basic CSS, specifically with the use of borders

// On the top left corner of the page, there will be a button that changes color to denote who’s turn it is, X or O. Plan on using Bootstrap for these buttons/as well as a command that will change the after a move has been set.

// In the top right corner there will be logout and reset buttons to allow a player to logout of their current game or give them the option to reset the game.

// Below the game board I will have a New game button to start a fresh game. Above that is where users will get their feedback (if they’ve stated a new game after reset, this will also “Welcome” the user upon login/stating a new game etc etc.

// The stats screen will just denote the total wins and losses and ties for a user. This will be made with module or just boxes. The “reset” button on this page will reset the scores.

// The change password screen will have the logout button in the top right again. Additionally, it will have a form-field for a username and a new password. Once those fields are complete, the user will hit the change password button. Then that event will take place/bring the user back to the initial login screen.

// One of the 8 winner scenarios will just denote text at the bottom stating the player has won. There will be a button to logout and one to reset to the home screen.
